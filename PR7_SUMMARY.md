# PR #7 - Dashboard Fix + Documentation Summary 🎉

## 🎯 What Was Done

### ✅ Critical Fix Applied
**Problem**: Users couldn't run the dashboard and got error:
```
Cannot locate tasks that match ':dashboard:build' as project 'dashboard' not found
```

**Solution**: Added one line to `settings.gradle`:
```gradle
include 'dashboard'
```

This registers the dashboard as a subproject in the Gradle multi-project build.

### ✅ Comprehensive Documentation Added

**Two new documentation files created:**

1. **DASHBOARD_QUICKSTART.md** (365 lines)
   - How to run the dashboard (3 different methods)
   - Connection guide for all scenarios
   - Complete feature usage instructions
   - Troubleshooting common issues
   - Data interpretation guide
   - Quick command reference

2. **DASHBOARD_LAYOUT.md** (311 lines)
   - ASCII art visual representation
   - Complete color coding guide
   - Live data update examples
   - Control panel breakdown
   - 4 example scenarios with expected behavior
   - Tips for best experience

---

## 🚀 Now Users Can:

```bash
# Build the dashboard
./gradlew :dashboard:build

# Run the dashboard GUI
./gradlew :dashboard:run

# Create standalone JAR
./gradlew :dashboard:jar
```
